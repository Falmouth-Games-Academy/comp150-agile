	\large\textbf{Current Question}
	
	\normalsize How can frequent play-testing during agile game development direct a project towards a more enjoyable product for the end user.\\
	\\
	\noindent
	\large\textbf{Ideas to look at}
	\begin{itemize}
	  \normalsize\item Game development isn't just about creating a working user friendly product like most software dev, but also making it an enjoyable experience?
	  \item Human testing vs automated, the later being easier to do regularly but doesn't show enjoyment?
	  \item
	\end{itemize}
