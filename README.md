#### [1]: VIRTUAL OFFICES (finished):

This paper revealed the lack of virtual business communication environments during the time the paper was written. The authors emphasised the need and proposal for new business communication environments consisting of shared and interactive multiuser virtual spaces that consists of computer-graphics-based virtual space and video-based objects. They later concluded that if it were to be applied properly, this combination could result in an extremely flexible environment for remote human collaboration.

"Computer systems and telecommunication networks make it possible to use these electronic tools more efficiently. The term “intelligent building” is used to represent this empowered business environment in a physical building. Intelligent buildings offer a comfortable and productivity-enhancing environment for the business people who work there and make full and frequent use of electronic tools."

"Existing communication tools are designed only for planned communication, where, for instance, a user must decide the party (i.e., telephone number) and topic before making the telephone call. New seamless communication tools for casual communication are therefore necessary." 
- Although this was published in 1993, this statement isn't as true today, as we have various virtual tools that we can use for casual communication, i.e. Skype, Discord, and many more. 

"Various media and modes, such as voice, non-verbal gestures, drawings, eye movement, text, and paper, are used for communication in real space. Existing communication tools are designed for each media separately. The user has to change tools depending on the media and communication modes. Therefore, communication tools that can support various media continuously and consistently are necessary." 
- The comment mentioned in the previous paragraph also applies here. Today we have virtual tools that go in conjunction with the various media and modes that were emphasised above, one of the more prominent ones being video calls, which is something like Skype - among others - supports.

"A concept for a new business communication environment has been proposed. The proposed system is a shared and interactive multi-user virtual space that consists of a CG-based virtual-space and video-based objects. This combination results in an extremely flexible environment for remote human collaboration. The human interface of walking and interacting within the virtual space offers a new dimension in daily communication activities. This feature should play an important role in future communication services."
- So..something like an MMORPG game, but more casual and for business?

This paper reinforced the importance of user stories and how a good understanding of them can lead to project success. 


#### Quotes
"Many tools for the visualization of story cards, however, do not exploit all features of these cards. Often, story cards are presented in lists, tables or other fixed structures."
- While "Trello" (among others) is organised in a number of lists or tables, it is quite versatile in terms of letting users use various features for their cards.

# Essay stuff
In the vast field of computer science including software development, computer networks, and many other computing areas, you will always encounter barriers and time constraints whether you expect them or not. Suddenly your colleague is absent one day, forcing you to improvise and finish up the rest of your group work before the approaching deadline, or maybe you are having an internal problem that is considerably prohibiting team productivity. For these reasons, I will be answering the following research question: **How does running daily stand-ups in a virtual office setting, using tools such as Slack, influence time-boxing and team productivity?** I will be focusing on how virtual tools influence time-boxing & team productivity, the importance of using virtual tools and the various effects they evoke on different people. I have chosen to explore this question because I feel like I have enough personal experience to discuss about this certain topic, something that I think will reinforce my facts and opinions. Additionally, I believe it to be an especially important issue in today's world of business and technology, where we can merge both to provide and receive good and realistically timed products. 

Firstly, you could argue that virtual tools are not essential. They are not required at all if, say, a team is fine at their current state of productivity. Why change what's not broken? Although, while it may temporarily tamper with progress, learning to cope and adapt to using virtual tools can vastly improve time-boxing, which thereafter positively affects team productivity. Even if it is minimal, simply communicating for a maximum of 5 minutes with your colleagues about your tasks and barriers is enough to provide information to the rest of the group, which they in turn could lend some assistance in if needed. This has an excellent effect in the long run, as it develops a sense of positivity and reassurance amongst the group members, resulting in elevated levels of team productivity, which consecutively decreases the potential problems that arise in terms of time-boxing.
