##Proposal
In the world of software development, the agile methodology has almost become a standard process that is used. Scrum is the most commonly used proccess within Agile, which focusses on delivering functioning software regularly as opposed to just one deliverable when a complete model has been made.  Based upon this information we can see that investor involvement is pretty much essential as they will be giving regular feedback on each deliverable. However, should this be the only input any external party should have? Should investors be allowed to sit in during team meetings or stand ups for example? What forms of input from the other interested parties be able to do without interfering with the productivity of the team? With this in mind if they were able to take part in these meetings would this allow them to constantly change things and make it harder for the team to micro-manage their tasks?
