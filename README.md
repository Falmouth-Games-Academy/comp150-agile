Essay on the Agile Philosophy

# Question
The question I am looking for an answer for to is how efficiently does the Agile method work when the team is distributed in different locations and how to improve on it to get the most from everyone. I intend to address it by looking at papers which focus on when the team is split up in different locations to see what problems can arise but also look at the benfits of not being together and by reading game developer blogs which talk about this topic to see their thoughts on it.
