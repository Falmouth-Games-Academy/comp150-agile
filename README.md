"How can game developers make effective use of the scrum board?"

I intend to address the question by comparing different ideas for using the scrum board effectively. Such as the different forms of boards from whiteboards with sticky notes to digital scrum boards [1][2][5] and their uses.
Additionally how it helps to keep the project moving [3] and adapting when needed [4].
