Essay on the Agile Philosophy

##Proposed Question/s.

* Is The Scrum Master A Typical Project Manager Or A Leader?

* Does the lack of a project manager in a scrum affect productivity?

* Does having a manager affect the Agile Method?

* Would The Agile Methodology Benefit From Having Greater Command And Control Influences? (This one)

##Proposal
In the modern world of software development the constant need for creating functional larger scale projects are becoming more common, this is putting a strain on the development teams across the world. One method that is fetching a greater popularity is the Agile methodology. This is a method that allows the developers to self-organise themselves into teams and choose which aspects of the project they wish to take on. A possible defect of this is the lack of a clear command and control aspect of the method. Without this clear command structure there is too much room for team disagreements and inactivity, thus affecting productivity. This lack of dedication or continuous disagreement to the project and its components will have detrimental effects on the final product. The Agile approach would be to find out what is causing this lack of productivity and work with and support the team member to solve this issue, but does this method actually work? Would a more forceful approach be of greater advantage to some aspects of the Agile methodology? This paper will be exploring whether or not having a greater presence of this command and control will positively or negatively affect the Agile Methodology.
