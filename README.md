[1]: VIRTUAL OFFICES (continue at "Video- Based Virtual Space"):

"Computer systems and telecommunication networks make it possible to use these electronic tools more efficiently. The term “intelligent building” is used to represent this empowered business environment in a physical building. Intelligent buildings offer a comfortable and productivity-enhancing environment for the business people who work there and make full and frequent use of electronic tools."

"Existing communication tools are designed only for planned communication, where, for instance, a user must decide the party (i.e., telephone number) and topic before making the telephone call. New seamless communication tools for casual communication are therefore necessary." 
- Although this was published in 1993, this statement isn't as true today, as we have various virtual tools that we can use for casual communication, i.e. Skype, Discord, and many more. 

"Various media and modes, such as voice, non-verbal gestures, drawings, eye movement, text, and paper, are used for communication in real space. Existing communication tools are designed for each media separately. The user has to change tools depending on the media and communication modes. Therefore, communication tools that can support various media continuously and consistently are necessary." 
- What I said on the previous paragraph also applies here. Today we have virtual tools that go in conjunction with the various media and modes that were mentioned, one of the more prominent ones being video calls, which is something Skype - among others - supports.
