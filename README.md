### Paper 1
#### Title: Is agility out there?: agile practices in game development
#### Citation: [1]
#### Abstract: 
“Game development is a very complex and multidisciplinary activity and surely the success of games as one of most profitable areas in entertainment domain could not be incidentally. The goal of this paper is to investigate if (and how) principles and practices from Agile Methods have been adopted in game development, mainly gathering evidences through Postmortem Analysis (PMA).
Then we describe how we have conducted PMA in order to identify the good practices adopted in several game development projects. The results are discussed, comparing similarities and differences on how these practices are taken in account in (traditional) software development and game development.”

### Paper 2
#### Title: Serious game development as an iterative user-centered agile software project
#### Citation: [2]
#### Abstract:
"Commissioned by the campus Office of Admissions, we have built a series of three campus tour and orientation games over the past academic year with undergraduate student project teams. Based on well-established game industry practices we followed an iterative agile process with Scrum and managed to avoid many classical pitfalls in game development. While we achieved some measure of success, in post-project analysis, it becomes obvious that our process would have benefited from the heavy emphasis of 'users' in the User-Centered Design (UCD) methods. In this position paper, we propose that the serious game development community continue to critically analyze the results from the UCD projects to benefit from its lessons, well-understood good practices, and development paradigms."

### Paper 3
#### Title: Software engineering senior design course: experiences with agile game development in a capstone project
#### Citation: [3]
#### Abstract:
"The importance of capstone senior design project courses is widely recognized for undergraduate software engineering curricula. They provide students with an opportunity to integrate and apply theoretical knowledge (both from previous courses and newly acquired for the project) on a team, improving both their technical and soft-skills. Here, we report our experiences using an agile development method for a game project; this is a radical shift from our previous course offerings that were based on waterfall, model driven development. This report is unique and valuable, especially for software engineering education, which goes beyond the discipline-specific limits of computer science curricula."

### Paper 4
#### Title: Opening up to agile games development
#### Citation: [4]
#### Abstract:
"In fast-paced business environments like computer games, Agile would seem to be the appropriate style of software development. However, our study of three computer game studios revealed that game development does not deploy Agile methods as such, but rather it shares some of Agile’s practices and values. We were intrigued by how agility was triggered in game development; triggers undocumented by proponents of Agile methods. This article distils our findings into guidelines for nurturing and enhancing agility in creative software organizations."

### Paper 5
#### Title: Game-Scrum: An Approach to Agile Game Development
#### Citation: [5]
#### Abstract:
"The use of agile methodologies for developing games has become very common. However, such methodologies must be adapted to the team reality and to the particularities of the game development. Since there are few agile methodologies that specifically address the problems found in game development, this paper aims at investigating some alternatives and suggests an approach to guide people who are starting in this area. The proposed methodology, named Game-Scrum, has been applied in the development of a game for teaching software engineering. The results from its application are also discussed in the paper."

### Paper 6
#### Title: Agile Game Development
#### Citation: [6]
#### Abstract:
"There are many facets of game development that make it uniquely challenging. Video games tend to have a much larger emphasis on performance than traditional applications and have much more subjective system requirements. Video game design is also more difficult than traditional software system design due to the complex interactions between objects. Since a large amount of the object interaction in video games happens in the user interface, there are also unique challenges in testing video games. These constraints make video game framework selection much more critical to the success of the game. The creative design process and the ability of the game to immerse its user is also very critical to the success of the game. In this paper we further discuss the unique challenges that game design poses to the software development community."
