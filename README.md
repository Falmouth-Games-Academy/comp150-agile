Essay on the Agile Philosophy

# Louis' Proposal
Proposal \#1: The application of agile philosophy in game development, its relative impact on cut or replaced content, and the pros and cons of said impact.

Owing to my enthusiasm for removed content in games, I would like to discover the effects of the agile philosophy on removed or replaced content--whether it results in more or less content being cut or replaced in games, compared to e.g. a waterfall approach. Further to that, I aim to discover the positive and negative impacts of this: if it results in a more cut content, is the end result an improvement? If not, does more content get made, and is it of a good quality? How does this effect the time span of game development, and does its psychological impact on the developers keep work fresh and inspired compared to other approaches?
