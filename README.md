# Proposals
## Research Proposal #1: How should agile teams manage cutting or replacing content in games
Owing to my interest in removed content in games, I would like to search and discover the effects of the agile philosophy on removed or replaced content--whether it results in more or less content being cut or replaced in games, compared to e.g. a waterfall approach. I aim to discover the positive and negative impacts of this: if it results in a more cut content, is the end result an improvement? If not, does more content get made, and is it of a good quality? How does it affect the time span of game development, and does its psychological impact on the developers keep work fresh and inspired compared to other approaches?

The interesting thing about the question is not strictly whether more content is lost, but whether or not it is a good thing. Agile works on an iterative philosophy, promoting fast creation of content in short, perhaps risky and innovative sprints; with the idea that risk is reduced over time as the final vision of the product is formed. Does it work? Is it in a good time span?

## Research proposal #2: Maximising and managing collaborative creativity in an agile workflow for game development
Agile development strongly promotes iteration, implying a bigger potential for experimentation. However, evidence suggests that further into the life cycle of a game, as its vision becomes more clearly defined and the deadline approaches, creativity goes to the back-burner, much as it does in more traditional waterfall workflows (though much sooner, during the planning phases). It calls into question whether a large-scale project would better benefit from a well-planned pre-production stage, followed by a fast rigid development phase--rather than the slow, iterative early development stage which will drive the ever-changing product throughout. However, with game development being an extremely risk-filled endeavor, and with it being well-established that games will change according to what is most preferred amongst players (as dictated by playtesting), is Agile development a slower but more effective solution?
## Research proposal #3: Managing creative differences, parallel construction, and blocking in roleless agile development
## Research proposal #4: How to select individual roles, and the strengths and weaknesses of specific roles in agile development
## Research proposal #5: How to cope with being surrounded by programmers smarter than you in an agile development environment
Unfortunately, competitive thinking takes a grip in the everyday life of terrible programmers, much as they do with normal people and also artists. This sadly can override communicative thinking, which is also not plentiful to begin with, and this creates issues for game development teams where it's vital that creative and technical direction are coordinated clearly through communication. However, with agile development forcing the programmers to stand up and commit to the best of their personal ability, and talk to other human beings and also programmers, there is much potential for forcibly improved communication. How does this compare to the traditional waterfall method wherein terrible programmers are confined to a safe place where their code can destroy the project subtly in the background, and experienced programmers experience regular sadness from being too good to tolerate it? Is it possible to make programmers talk, instead of violently hacking each others' hypothetical Facebook accounts? What benefits does agile development bring in a hostile environment of memory leaks and cache misses?
## Research proposal #6: How agile philosophy can benefit personal learning in an educational environment, and comparison with other development methodologies
Does the iterative development promote personal learning in technical sense? How about communication?
## Research proposal #7: How to manage priorities, skills and communication in a roleless Agile-oriented team environment
A roleless game development environment--one where everyone has their strengths, with none fully recognised yet.
