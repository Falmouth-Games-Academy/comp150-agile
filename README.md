### Topic
##### Is the Agile methodology more or less effective than heavily Plan-Based methods in the games industry, particularly in large game companies?
In this essay I intend to analyse the key differences between the waterfall approach and agile approach in the games industry, specifically which methods perform better in larger game studios compared with smaller independent teams. I will look at how the size of the game can affect which approach is more likely to be used and why? 

### Paper 1
#### Title: 
Costs of compliance: agile in an inelastic organization
#### Citation: 
[1]
#### Abstract:
Doing agile development in a relatively inelastic environment, where policies and procedures are virtually unchangeable, creates an impedance mismatch between the agile team and its host organization. Our experience on a variety of embedded Java projects has shed some light on the costs of complying (or failing to comply), where we trialed everything from "refusal to comply" to "full compliance". Regardless of approach, there was always an associated cost, whether in redrafting documents, reducing functionality, spending time in meetings, losing focus on deliverables, or deteriorating morale. In keeping with the Agile philosophy, when our efforts were failing, we refactored our approach to managing the project in an effort to minimize the costs of compliance without adopting more risk to ensure success. In the end we were faced with the questions "How did we fare in the end? Which costs were worth bearing? Was it all worth it?".

### Paper 2
#### Title: 
Are the Old Days Gone? A Survey on Actual Software
Engineering Processes in Video Game Industry
#### Citation:
[2]
#### Abstract:
In the past 10 years, several researches studied video game development process who proposed approaches to improve the way how games are developed. These approaches usually adopt agile methodologies because of claims that traditional practices and the waterfall process are gone. However, are the "old days" really gone in the game industry? In this paper, we present a survey of software engineering processes in video game industry from postmortem project analyses. We analyzed 20 postmortems from Gamasutra Portal. We extracted their processes and modelled them through using the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). This work presents three main contributions. First, a postmortem analysis methodology to identify and extract project processes. Second, the study main result: the "old days" are gone, but not completely. Iterative practices are increasing and are applied to at least 65% of projects in which 45% of this projects explicitly adopted Agile practices. However, waterfall process is still applied at least 30% of projects. Finally, we discuss some implications, directions and opportunities for video game development community.

### Paper 3
#### Title: 
Assessing an Organization's Capability to Effectively Implement Its Selected Agile Method(s): An Objectives, Principles, Strategies Approach
#### Citation:
[3]
#### Abstract:
Agile methods provide an organization or a team with the flexibility to adopt a selected subset of principles and practices based on their culture, their values, and the types of systems that they develop. More specifically, every organization or team implements a customized agile method, tailored to better accommodate its needs. However, the extent to which a customized method supports the organizational objectives, i.e. the 'goodness' of that method, should be demonstrable. Existing agile assessment approaches focus on comparative analyses, or are limited in scope and application. In this research, we present a systematic, comprehensive approach to assessing the 'goodness' of agile methods. We examine an agile method based on (1) its adequacy, (2) the capability of the organization to support the adopted principles and practices specified by the method, and (3) the method's effectiveness. We employ the Objectives, Principles and Strategies (OPS) Framework to guide our assessment process. The Framework (a) specifies objectives of the agile philosophy, (b) identifies principles that support the objectives, (c) designates strategies that implement the principles, (d) defines linkages that relate objectives to principles, and principles to strategies, and (e) prescribes indicators for assessing the extent to which an organization supports the implementation and effectiveness of those strategies. The propagation of indicator values along the linkages provides a multi-level assessment view of the agile method. In this paper, we discuss our assessment approach and substantiation results.

### Paper 4
#### Title: 
Towards Agent-based Agile approach for Game Development Methodology
#### Citation:
[4]
#### Abstract:
Game development is very complex and the success of the game is based on the game development methods. The purpose of this paper is to investigate on the existing game development methods and provide an upcoming game development method that is based on predictive and adaptive development models. A critical analysis to Agile method which are mostly used in modern game development methods is presented. We identified the weakness of Agile game development and solve it by creating a cooperation with Agent Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) to introduce a new hybrid methodology named as Agent Agile Game Development Methodology (AAGDM) that combines both predictive and adaptive models.

### Paper 5
#### Title: 
Using risk to balance agile and plan-driven methods
#### Citation:
[5]
#### Abstract:
Both agile and plan-driven approaches have situation-dependent shortcomings that, if not addressed, can lead to project failure. The challenge is to balance the two approaches to take advantage of their strengths in a given situation while compensating for their weaknesses. The authors present a risk-based approach for structuring projects to incorporate both agile and plan-driven approaches in proportion to a project's needs.

### Paper 6
#### Title: 
Comparing extreme programming and Waterfall project results
#### Citation:
[6]
#### Abstract:
Waterfall and Extreme Programming are two software project methods used for project management. Although there are a number of opinions comparing the two methods regarding how they should be applied, none have used project data to clearly conclude which one is better. In this paper, we present the results of a controlled empirical study conducted at Carnegie Mellon University in Silicon Valley to learn about the effective transition from traditional development to agile development. We conducted a comparison research against these two approaches. Multiple teams were assigned a project; some used Waterfall development, others used Extreme Programming. The purpose of this research is to look at advantages and disadvantages based upon the outcomes, generated artifacts, and metrics produced by the teams.
