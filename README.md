Essay on the Agile Philosophy

Presentation Notes
Key Details:
- Explore relationship between personality types
and preference for agile.
- Using the five-factor model of personality,
known as the ‘Big Five’. 
- Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness,
Neuroticism and Openness. 
- There is a consensus amongst psychologists, that
these five types are representative of the fundamental base differences in
personality traits.
- Investigate ways individuals can better adapt to
agile processes.  
- The agile process has a strong focus on social
interactions and it is therefore unsurprising to find a positive correlation
between an individual’s openness and extraversion, and their preference for
agile.
- Agile also requires an ability to adapt to
change, to accept feedback and to be able to successful self-manage: these
things can be more challenging for some personality types than others.

Contribution: 

For team members: Finding methods for those who struggle
with agile processes to better adapt will benefit the team. 

For stakeholders: A variety of personalities and skill-sets
in individuals within a team tends to enhance performance, therefore it is
important not to disregard those who struggle with agile principles. Finding
methods that give individuals the autonomy to align their working style with
agile, may help ensure diversity within teams. Although not linear, numerous
studies have found a positive correlation between team-diversity and
performance.

Hypothesis: 

Although a relationship between openness, extraversion and a
preference for agile has been found, I suspect to find other influences on
preference and therefore, ways for individuals to better adapt to agile.
