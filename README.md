Essay on the Agile Philosophy

How can the principles of Agile Development be used to successfully identify, manage and enhance different personalities within self-organising teams?

If there is a correlation between a preference for agile methods, openness and extraversion, how can other personality types best adapt to the agile development process?

"The data supports a positive relationship between extraversion and agile preference as well as openness and agile preference." [1] "The results from the quantitative data collected from the survey study indicate that three out of the five personality factors from the Five Factor Model show a correlation with above average preference for agile methods. These factors are extra version, openness and neuroticism. The first two have a positive relationship with agile preference while neuroticism (emotional instability) has a negative relationship with agile methodology preference." [1]

"a cohesive team of members who collaborate and trust each other can be difficult for developers who are accustomed to working predominantly on their own." [2] "We found that agile methods increased trust by increasing transparency, accountability, communication, and knowledge sharing and feedback." [2] "The accountability and collective responsibility in agile methods nurture trust by facilitating vigilance, aligning members' perceptions realistically with individual competences and abilities"[2] "Using agile practices also helped alleviate the distrust that distributed team members from different cultures can experience"[2] "A failure to deliver tasks might also demonstrate a lack of competence and thereby diminish trust between team members."[2]

"team structures tend to be rather more fluid in agile projects, forming, growing, shrinking and disbanding as particular skill needs arise or are dealt with. The higher number and greater diversity of individuals involved, combined with the less rigid nature of their involvement, may increase the incidence of personnel incompatibilities and, therefore, the potential for conflict." [3] "Among his findings he also reported that individuals who possess premium quality in one respect are often lacking in others, and that combining individuals with similar personality traits reduces performance." [3]

"They observed that effective communication, comfort working with others, self confidence, and ability to compromise are the four essential traits for effective pair programming." [4] "They found that students' perception of their partner's skill level has a significant influence on their compatibility" [4] "found that students with more confidence in their programming skills like pair programming the least." [4]
