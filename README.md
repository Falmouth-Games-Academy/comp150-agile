Proposal \#1: How should agile teams manage the way they cut or replace content in games

Owing to my enthusiasm for removed content in games, I would like to discover the effects of the agile philosophy on removed or replaced content--whether it results in more or less content being cut or replaced in games, compared to e.g. a waterfall approach. Further to that, I aim to discover the positive and negative impacts of this: if it results in a more cut content, is the end result an improvement? If not, does more content get made, and is it of a good quality? How does this effect the time span of game development, and does its psychological impact on the developers keep work fresh and inspired compared to other approaches?
