### Paper 1
#### Title: A Mathematical Theory of Communication
#### Citation: [1]
#### Abstract: 
“The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and
PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified the interest
in a general theory of communication. A basis for such a theory is contained in the
important papers of Nyquist and Hartley on this subject. In the present paper we
will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of
noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the
original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information.”

#### Comments: 
This is a seminal article, which laid the foundations for what we now call
information theory. It has been cited more than 76 000 times, making it one of the
most-cited articles in computer science.
