Essay on the Agile Philosophy

**Agile Research Essay Proposal**

For my essay I will be addressing the question "How can frequent play-testing during agile development direct a project towards a better end product." To address this question I will be looking mainly at research articles focusing on play-testing effects on development, different types of play-testing and articles looking at where play-testing fits with current agile development processes. I would like to look into the viability of more frequent play-testing for smaller companies vs bigger ones as well to help companies see where this research and fit in for them.
