Agile Development Essay Question: How Can the Scrum Master Help Improve Workflow of a Project?

The modern era is constantly advancing technology in leaps and bounds so development teams must come up with better ways of developing software than the original linear/waterfall method that relied on the work being fully planned out before beginning any work. The Agile Development Practises however work on a day to day planning then working basis in sessions such as scrums. These scrums are set up so that all the work done in the previous day is reviewed and then if anything needs changing the scrum master, the one in charge of managing the scrums, adjust the work plan for that day to maximise the scrums overall output. The scrum master also gets information from the product owner that includes input from end-users, stakeholders and customers.

A Scrum Master has a very important role within the Agile Development Practises. It's their job to hold daily stand-up meetings and to make sure all work is being progressed through steadily without fault. The scrum master will also address if someone is taking on to many projects at once and sort out how that can be amended. The scrum master however is not the overall boss of the project.
