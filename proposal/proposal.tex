\item[Title:] Back to Basics: The Role of Agile Principles in Success with an Distributed Scrum Team
\item[Citation:] \cite{11}
\item[Abstract:] ``Agile processes rely on feedback and communication to work and they often work best with co-located teams for this reason. Sometimes agile makes sense because of project requirements and a distributed team makes sense because of resource constraints. A distributed team can be productive and fun to work on if the team takes an active role in overcoming the barriers that distribution causes. This is the story of how one product team used creativity, communications tools, and basic good engineering practices to build a successful product.''

\item[Comments:] Talks about how scrum works efficiently if the team has an active role in overcoming the barriers that distribution causes, this is relevant because it talks about solutions to overcome the challenges they faced.

\item[Title:] Distributed Agile Development: Using Scrum in a Large Project
\item[Citation:] \cite{bibtex_key}
\item[Abstract:] While seemingly incompatible, combining large-scale global software development and agile practices is a challenge undertaken by many companies. Case study reports on the successful use of agile practices in small distributed projects already exist. How these practices could be applied to larger projects, however, remains unstudied. This paper reports a case study on agile practices in a 40-person development organization distributed between Norway and Malaysia. Based on seven interviews in the development organization, we describe how Scrum practices were successfully applied, e.g., using teleconference and web cameras for daily scrum meetings, synchronized 4-week sprints and weekly scrum-of-scrums. Additional agility supporting practices for distributed projects were identified, e.g., frequent visits, unofficial distributed meetings and annual gatherings are described.

\item[Comments:] Speaks about how scrum helps break down the key challenge in distributed agile which is communication on a 40 man project between 2 teams in Norway and Malaysia. This is important because they narrow down their main probelm to be communication.

\item[Title:] Why Scrum Works: A Case Study from an Agile Distributed Project in Denmark and India
\item[Citation:] \cite{bibtex_key}
\item[Abstract:] Scrum seems to work extremely well as an agile project management approach. An obvious question is why. To answer that question, we carried out a longitudinal case study of a distributed project using Scrum across Denmark and India. In our analysis of case study data we used three selected theoretical frameworks. We conclude that Scrum works so well because it provides communication, social integration, control, and coordination mechanisms that are especially useful for distributed and agile project management.

\item[Full text link:] \url{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/document/6005502/}
\item[Comments:] Talks about the challenges of distributed scrum, how they overcame it in their project and why they think it works so well because it provides communication, social integration, control, and coordination mechanisms if done correctly.
