\section*{Topic}

My essay will be on: My agile development question revolves around one specific part of the Agile Development process and that is "User Stories", and how I intend to answer the aforementioned question is to delve deeper into first, what a User Story is and how it is used by members of the development team in the development cycle to create a finished product, and then go further and look at how the user stories are created in the first place, and thus prioritised amongst the team members and on the Scrum Board, and as there are different methods of prioritising these user stories such as Walking Skeleton and the MoSCow method, I will compare and contrast these individual methods, and by using my research gained from my noted sources, I will be able to ascertain which is the most efficient for teams in a games development environment. And from these reflections on the different methods and the ways that they change the development teams behaviour and work pattern I will be able to draw a final conclusion on my question and whether further research is required to gain a better understanding of the impact it can have on the development time of a project in the video games industry.

\item[Title:] Is agility out there?: agile practices in game development
\item[Citation:] \cite{petrillo2010agility}
\item[Abstract:] ``Game development is a very complex and multidisciplinary activity and surely the success of games as one of most profitable areas in entertainment domain could not be incidentally. The goal of this paper is to investigate if (and how) principles and practices from Agile Methods have been adopted in game development, mainly gathering evidences through Postmortem Analysis (PMA).

Then we describe how we have conducted PMA in order to identify the good practices adopted in several game development projects. The results are discussed, comparing similarities and differences on how these practices are taken in account in (traditional) software development and game development.''

\item[Comments:] This paper investigates how agile principles and practice are applied in game development. Also states that having a qualified team is the where most good practice will take place.

\item[Title:] Towards Agent-based Agile approach for Game Development Methodology
\item[Citation:] \cite{al2014towards}
\item[Abstract:] Game development is very complex and the success of the game is based on the game development methods. The purpose of this paper is to investigate on the existing game development methods and provide an upcoming game development method that is based on predictive and adaptive development models. A critical analysis to Agile method which are mostly used in modern game development methods is presented. We identified the weakness of Agile game development and solve it by creating a cooperation with Agent Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) to introduce a new hybrid methodology named as Agent Agile Game Development Methodology (AAGDM) that combines both predictive and adaptive models.

\item[Title:] Prioritising user stories in agile environment
\item[Citation:] \cite{popli2014prioritising}
\item[Abstract:] In the last few years Agile methodologies appeared as a reaction to traditional software development methodologies. In Agile environment the requirements from the client are always taken in the form of user-stories and prioritization of requirements is done by Moscow method, validate learning and walking skeleton methods. By literature survey it has been observed that these methods are not efficient because they do not consider importance of user-stories by client. In this research work some importance related and effort related factors are considered on the basis of which the prioritization of user-stories is done. Further the feasibility of work has been validated by a case study of Enable Quiz which is a lightweight technical quizzing solution; for companies that hire engineers. The research work will allows the companies to better screen job candidates and assess their internal talent for skills development.

\item[Title:] How to reduce user story reopen count in Scrum development?
\item[Citation:] \cite{chauhan2015reduce}
\item[Abstract:] A user story (US) is reopened for reworking due to shortcomings from four major fronts- business analyst (BA), developer, quality analyst (QA) and environmental issues. BA is responsible for capturing requirements and documenting the requirements in the form of user stories; developer is responsible for the implementation of the user story; and the QA is responsible for testing of US. Now if any of three does not perform his job accurately then the probability of reopening of US increases. So we can reduce the probability of reopening of US by improving on shortcoming from three ends BA, developer and QA. As for as environmental issues, are concerned, they can be controlled by QA, developer and BA. The aim of the paper is to identify different areas from BA, Developer and QA's end to reduce the probability of reopening of a US and thereby reducing the user story reopen count in the Scrum development.

\item[Title:]Using prototypes in early pervasive game development
\item[Citation:] \cite{koivisto2007using}
\item[Abstract:] In this paper, we discuss using various prototyping methods in early game development. We have playtested pervasive game prototypes using agile software prototype development methods and guided paper prototyping methods. We give examples of four pervasive games where both paper-prototyping and software-prototyping methods are used. We also compare results that have been achieved by testing games with the potential end users of the game and with colleagues or other experts. The benefits and disadvantages of the methods are discussed and their use in the game development process is described, i.e. when the methods should be used and what should be considered when using them.

\item[Title:] Forging high-quality User Stories: Towards a discipline for Agile Requirements 
\item[Citation:] \cite{lucassen2015forging}
\item[Abstract:] User stories are a widely used notation for formulating requirements in agile development projects. Despite their popularity in industry, little to no academic work is available on assessing their quality. The few existing approaches are too generic or employ highly qualitative metrics. We propose the Quality User Story Framework, consisting of 14 quality criteria that user story writers should strive to conform to. Additionally, we introduce the conceptual model of a user story, which we rely on to design the AQUSA software tool. AQUSA aids requirements engineers in turning raw user stories into higher-quality ones by exposing defects and deviations from good practice in user stories. We evaluate our work by applying the framework and a prototype implementation to three user story sets from industry.
