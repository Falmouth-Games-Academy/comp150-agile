\abstract{In the vast field of computer science including software development, computer networks, and many other computing areas, you will always encounter barriers and time constraints whether you expect them or not. Suddenly your colleague is absent one day, forcing you to improvise and finish up the rest of your group work before the approaching deadline, or maybe you are having an internal problem that is considerably prohibiting team productivity. For these reasons, I will be answering the following research question: How does running daily stand-ups in a virtual office setting, using tools such as Slack, influence time-boxing and team productivity?}

\section{Introduction}

I will be focusing on how virtual tools influence time-boxing & team productivity, the importance of using virtual tools and the various effects they evoke on different people. I have chosen to explore this question because I feel like I have enough personal experience to discuss about this certain topic, something that I think will reinforce my facts and opinions. Additionally, I believe it to be an especially important issue in today's world of business and technology, where we can merge both to provide and receive good and realistically timed products.

--Write your introduction here. A brief introduction is recommended, which should outline key details of the chosen topic and the reviewed papers, motivate the work, and provide a roadmap of key points to the reader. The motivation is quite important here, as essays should have a contribution (i.e., what is the point of the essay, and what does the reader take away from the essay) and the link between the motivation (in the introduction) and the contribution (in the conclusion) should be made clear.--

\section{Your section title here}

Firstly, you could argue that virtual tools are not essential. They are not required at all if, say, a team is fine at their current state of productivity. Why change what's not broken? Although, while it may temporarily tamper with progress, learning to cope and adapt to using virtual tools can vastly improve time-boxing, which thereafter positively affects team productivity. Even if it is minimal, simply communicating for a maximum of 5 minutes with your colleagues about your tasks and barriers is enough to provide information to the rest of the group, which they in turn could lend some assistance in if needed. This has an excellent effect in the long run, as it develops a sense of positivity and reassurance amongst group members, resulting in elevated levels of team productivity, which consecutively decreases the potential problems that could arise in terms of time-boxing.

--Write the main body of your essay here. Add more sections if appropriate. You may choose to write about each of your three papers in its own section, or you may choose a different structure. Either way, remember that you are being assessed on technical insight and analysis: it is not enough to merely summarise the contents of the three papers. You must demonstrate the ability to make inferences beyond what is written in the papers, and to draw the three papers together into a single coherent narrative.--

--Your essay must make a clear recommendation, in terms of which of the three techniques you have reviewed is the best according to whichever metric or metrics you feel is most appropriate. You must justify your choice, backing it up with empirical evidence. However remember that an academic essay is not a murder mystery: you should already have briefly discussed your recommendation in the introduction and in other parts of the essay. Do not save it for a grand reveal at the end.--

\section{Conclusion}

Write your conclusion here. The conclusion should do more than summarise the essay, making clear the contribution of the work and highlighting key points, limitations, and outstanding questions. It should not introduce any new content or information.
