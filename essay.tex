\abstract{My agile development question revolves around one specific part of the Agile Development process and that is "User Stories", and how I intend to answer the aforementioned question is to use the knowledge we have gained from my research to ascertain whether the methods used to distribute them hold an effective place in games development, as after all they are an integral part of Agile Development practice as they are the medium of which developers are given their work in the development cycle to create a finished product, and then go further and look at the distribution methods such as Walking Skeleton and the MoSCow method, I will compare and contrast these individual methods, and by using my research gained from my noted sources, I will be able to ascertain if these methods have any effective place in the games development field, how they might by game developers, and if they are useful at all. And from these reflections on the different methods, I will be able to draw a final conclusion on my question and whether further research is required to gain a better understanding of the impact it can have on the usefulness of these methods in the video games industry.} 

\section{Introduction}

As the principles and philosophy of Agile Development is now common practice in both software and games development, the smaller parts of the overall "Agile" umbrella become more and more important to pick apart and evaluate to make sure that development goes as smoothly as possible and that "valuable software" and software is created "early and continuous" \cite{agilemanifesto}, so that projects are delivered to customers on time, which after all is the first point of the Agile Manifesto. And as User Stories are the way that work is presented to developers, their creation and distribution must be closely monitored to ensure that the scope of the project is not under or over evaluated, and that members of the team are not over encumbered with work or tasks they can't carry out efficiently, which would extend the length of a project; and there are several methods of User Story distribution that I have discovered through my research that are generally used in Agile Development, but I want to discover if these hold any place in the Games Development field and if they have the ability to aid development in anyway, and from my research, it seems that they don't have ability to.


\section{Transferability of Agile practice into games development}

Through my research, I have found that there is quite a divide on my topic, and the usefulness of such distribution methods, with my first source outlining a relatively large, self created distribution method that according to the source is "really simple and easy to understand" \cite{popli2014prioritising}, which is always important when working under such tight time constraints and milestones that are found in the modern Games Industry, however they also state that the method is only suitable for the "prioritization of small and medium size project can be calculated efficiently" \cite{popli2014prioritising}, which makes it good for general software development and Indie Games, where a usually multi-skilled team is working on a project and thus can cover several disciplines, however it seems to me that it would be quite redundant for typical AAA Development as staff are normally very specialised and won't normally cross over to other disciplines in normal development practice. To further back this up, I again turn to Source 2 even goes as to say that "Prioritization of user-stories is a difficult task in agile environment because of its volatile nature." \cite{popli2014prioritising}, which is especially true of games development as there are many factors that can affect the length of a sprint, as mentioned by Al-azawi, Ayesh and Obaidy, such as "Feature Creep" \cite{al2014towards} which entails "new functionality is added during the development phase to increase project scope and change schedule time" \cite{al2014towards} and these type of events are what I would describe as volatile and such can affect the sprint length on a project, along with causing other issues such as "increased error, possible defects and increased chances of failure" \cite{al2014towards} which again in turn can also lead to increased sprint time, but then again, they only state that this is applicable to "Unmanaged" \cite{al2014towards} Feature Creep, and there are many case studies into methods that are meant to keep feature creep to a minimum during development, such as this one by Scott Crabtree, who outlines many methods of reducing feature creeps effects such as "Work through the design as thoroughly as you can, as early as you can"\cite{featurecreep}, which echos back to another method of game development which is Waterfall, where a very large design document is created at the start of a project, outlining all of the features the game will have, however as with all collaborative projects, especially on the scale of AAA game development, different parties will make changes and not update the document, so features go unwritten but are planned to be implemented which creates unnessecary work and strain on the team, which is why Agile Development techniques or atleast work ethics from the Agile Philosophy are now being implemented into games development, along with software development, which has been embracing Agile for longer than the games industry and when research was carried out by Pettrillo and Pimenta, they found that "good practices adopted in the traditional software industry are also found in the games industry"\cite{petrillo2010agility}, which points to a positive as surely the methods used in traditional development carry should carry over to games, however they go on to say "In both studies, the quality of the team was dominant for the success of the project"\cite{petrillo2010agility}, again pointing back to my earlier point that outside factors such as team structure and specialisation are more important to a project,  which is why we'll now take a look closer at the way methods used in regular development and see whether they have any significance in Games Development.

\section{Distribution Methods in a Games Development Context and their usefullness}
Out of the 4 Distribution Methods I have found in my research, I found that 2 only two would be be effective if transferred to a game development context, and these are Validated Learning and MoSCow\cite{popli2014prioritising}, with Validated Learning revolving around the development of the most risky features first, and then taking the feedback from that and applies that knowledge into future development, which is good for developers that work on the Early Access or release Beta and Alpha versions of their projects, which could apply to both Indie and AAA development in today's market, but again linking back to my earlier point that, especially early on in development, that feature creep will come into play and slow the development down due to the inclusion of new features demanded by the feedback. And MoSCow works on the basis that User Stories will be divided into 4 parts of importance from "Must have this" to "Won't have this"\cite{popli2014prioritising}, and this method is good for traditional development but as stated in the previous paragraph, AAA games development now normally outline everything they want in the product to begin with, as to prevent factors such as Feature Creep, and games normally have an end deadline so features that won't have time to implemented won't get included in the stories , so again not very useful in the grand scheme of things. 


\section{Conclusion}
To conclude, the distribution methods used in traditional development would seem to not transfer to games development to any large effect, as there are too many outside factors and pre-existing systems in place to create any lasting effect, as found, the use of a qualified and focused team were the main deciding factor on a quality product as the end result, and the methods would simply take the place of already exisiting practices, and thus there's no point in using them.
