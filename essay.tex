\section{Introduction}

In this essay I will outline the key benefits and drawbacks of daily scrum meetings and using my knowledge gained from research to discuss how they could be leveraged or overcome to make daily scrum meetings as effective as possible. I will first outline what a daily scrum meeting is and why it is important and useful, I will then discuss the benefits, drawbacks, and solutions to those drawbacks of efficient daily scrum meetings found in my research and give my own conclusions, followed by the final conclusion. In this paper I hope to provide solutions to the most common obstacles to having an efficient daily meeting and highlight good practice in a daily meetings. After reading this you should know how to make the most out of daily scrum meetings and be as productive as possible.

\section{Daily Scrum}

A daily scrum meeting is a daily 15-minute meeting, allowing the members of a team to inspect the progress of work and to remove impediments It is established by the Scrum master and takes place each day at the same place and time, thus avoiding unnecessary coordination. Each team member answers the following three questions: (1) What have you worked on since the last meeting? (2) What will you work on until the next meeting? (3) Have any impediments occurred? [1]. It is the Scrum masters responsibility to resolve any impediments that arise during the meeting. Team members meet in front of a task board and update their status of work [5], allowing team to check the status of sprint backlog items on a daily basis and thus keeps the team focused [1].

\section{Obstacles to Efficeint Meetings}

One of the keys to an efficient daily meeting is to complete the meeting at the right time of day for the right amount of time in order to be productive by not wasting time. In a case study I researched [3] it was found that there were many temporal obstacles to an efficient meeting. They observed that people often arrived late to meetings which meant the meeting would not start on time. This means that time is wasted for those who arrive on time. It was also found that many of the meetings in the case study lasted longer than 15 minutes. This was usually caused by people doing things like doodling on their notepad or using their phones. It was found that meetings lasted between 7 and 45 minutes with a mean of 22 minutes, which meant that the cost in time of the meeting was 47% more than planned. In addition to these obstacles, the meetings were not always at the same time of day. In cases where people have their daily meeting at the start of each day this is an issue. This is because team members wouldn't usually start tasks from the backlog until after the daily meeting, so if the daily meeting doesn't always happen at the start of day a lot of time will be wasted. Along with all of these temporal obstacles, I found in my research that many team members perceived the meeting as an interruption of their workflow and would prefer fewer meetings. One paper discussed how having meetings every day can be bad in some cases. For example in cases where employees are assigned to several teams at the same time, daily meetings in each of the teams would lead to severe constraints on behalf of those employees [1].
