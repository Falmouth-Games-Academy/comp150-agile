\abstract The agile development methodology is the most prominent within the software development. It is at it's core designed to be agile and to be adaptable to each team. However that can also lead teams failing to fully utilise the agile methodology  in this paper I would like to explore how the agile method can be best used to maximise the morale of a team and to maintain that morale across a project. (72 Words)

\section{Introduction}

The Agile development methodology is the most commonly used software development practice, and paired along with the Scrum methodology it has been shown in several case studies [cite:case studies] to have improved efficiency. However does this improved efficiency have an impact on the team morale? In this paper I will explore how agile and scrum will impact the overall morale of the team, through the use of existing case studies and from insight and reflective summaries of projects within the gaming industry.

Ignoring the various flawed implementations of agile, an example being what Martin Fowler describes as a "Flaccid Scrum".Then focusing only on the variation of the agile methodology tailored to best suit the team, it's in this optimal state that I wish to explore as it's the 'working' build of agile for that team.

\section{First Case study}

Write the main body of your essay here. Add more sections if appropriate. You may choose to write about each of your three papers in its own section, or you may choose a different structure. Either way, remember that you are being assessed on technical insight and analysis: it is not enough to merely summarise the contents of the three papers. You must demonstrate the ability to make inferences beyond what is written in the papers, and to draw the three papers together into a single coherent narrative.

Your essay must make a clear recommendation, in terms of which of the three techniques you have reviewed is the best according to whichever metric or metrics you feel is most appropriate. You must justify your choice, backing it up with empirical evidence. However remember that an academic essay is not a murder mystery: you should already have briefly discussed your recommendation in the introduction and in other parts of the essay. Do not save it for a grand reveal at the end.

\section{Conclusion}

Write your conclusion here. The conclusion should do more than summarise the essay, making clear the contribution of the work and highlighting key points, limitations, and outstanding questions. It should not introduce any new content or information.
