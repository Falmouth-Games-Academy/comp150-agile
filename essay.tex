\section{Introduction To be completed}

Write your introduction here. A brief introduction is recommended, which should outline key details of the chosen topic and the reviewed papers, motivate the work, and provide a roadmap of key points to the reader. The motivation is quite important here, as essays should have a contribution (i.e., what is the point of the essay, and what does the reader take away from the essay) and the link between the motivation (in the introduction) and the contribution (in the conclusion) should be made clear.
